# Medical Imaging Research Software Group

The Medical Imaging Research Software Group (MIRSG) is a sub-group of the ARC Collaborations product that is run as a join initiative with Prof. Geoff Parker in the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC).

## How We Work

### Planning Work

- All development and operational work is planned and tracked on GitHub.
- The [MIRSG GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/UCL-MIRSG/projects/3) provides views across all our activities.
- A more in depth diagram of how various repositories and issue types fit together can be found in [structure.md](structure.md).
- [Work-items and issue types](./work-items.md), as well as [example issue workflows](./issue-workflows.md) are documented in this repository.

### Recording XNAT and OMERO Projects

- Every study/project managed on a MIRSG run XNAT or OMERO instance should have a project record tracked as a [**[RECORD]** issue in this repository](https://github.com/UCL-MIRSG/MIRSG/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project-record&template=mirsg-project.md&title=%5BRECORD%5D%3A+%3Ctitle%3E)
- Each MIRSG Project Record may be linked to 0 or more related [issues on the ARC Opportunities Tracker](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/research-software-opportunities/issues).
  - Discussions related to funding should take place in the opportunities tracker repository so that it can be easily managed as part of the wider ARC Collaborations portfolio.

### Tracking Requests

- Non-trivial requests received should be tracked as a [**[REQUEST]** issue in this repository](https://github.com/UCL-MIRSG/MIRSG/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&template=request.yml&title=%5BREQUEST%5D%3A+).
- Important actions and internal discussions should be recorded as comments on the request issue itself.
- If a request is routine and easily resolved there is no need to create an issue.
- Requests may result in the identification of bugs, feature requests, configuration changes or other tasks - these should be tracked as indicated in [Tracking Issues](#tracking-issues).

### Tracking Issues

- Generally issues should be created in the repository to which they most relate.
- If it is difficult to identify where an issue should be added, create it in this repository.
- Important actions and discussions should be recorded as comments on the issue itself.

### Documentation

- Documentation related directly to MIRSG solutions is stored in GitHub in the same repository as the feature.
- General documents related to admin and service support is stored in the [MIRSG Sharepoint folder](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/UCLMIRSG-mirsg/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx) and the [MIRSG UCL Wiki space](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/MIRSG/).
- Completed XNAT and OMERO project request forms should be stored in the [MIRSG Sharepoint folder](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/UCLMIRSG-mirsg/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx) and linked to in the Project Record in this repository.

### Communications

- The [mirsg-private](https://ucl-arc.slack.com/archives/C02LDRMR78F) channel on the UCL-ARC Slack is the primary means of communicating between ARC staff who are members of MIRSG.
- The [mirsg-service](https://ucl-arc.slack.com/archives/C04ABE6944R) channel on the UCL-ARC Slack is accessible by all members of ARC and used for service and support related discussions specific to MIRSG activities.
- Many of the key researchers that we interact with are contactable through the [Medical Imaging Research Software Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a2fa04440a00f41518ea108162f5e1aa6%40thread.tacv2/conversations) which includes an XNAT Group channel with some key users.
