# Work Items and Issue Types

Across MIRSG-related repositories the following work items and issue types are defined and standardised.
This helps with planning and tracking information across all of our activities, and in pulling information together on the [MIRSG GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/UCL-MIRSG/projects/3).

## Summary of Implemented Work Items

### Product Focussed

- ‚ú® **Feature** - A discrete and defined piece of functionality that fulfills user needs - *e.g. [FEATURE] Add support for XNAT Container Service via Kubernetes*
- üìù **Story** -  A need or use case expressed from a user's perspective as ‚Äúpersona + need + purpose.‚Äù- *e.g. [STORY] As a researcher, I want to be able to run my analysis from XNAT, so that I don't need to move my data*

### Development Focussed

- ‚úèÔ∏è **Task** - Smallest unit of work to deliver a change - usually doable in a single day - *e.g. [TASK] Create a Kubernetes cluster*
- üêõ **Problem** - Identified bugs and impediments, as well as ongoing discoveries. - *e.g. [PROBLEM] K8s permissions prevent access*

### Service Focussed

- üì• **Request** - Details of a user request received, that may result in the creation of other work items. - *e.g. [REQUEST] Installation of analysis container*
- üî• **Incident** - An issue keeping track of degradations in service provision. - *e.g. [INCIDENT] XNAT Container Service is not connecting to compute*

## Proposed but not Implemented Work Items

- üê≥ **Epic** - A business initiative to be accomplished - usually through a set of related features - *e.g. [EPIC] Enable compute integration with XNAT*
- üë• **Discussion** - A suggestion, idea, or request for comment to get documented consensus on a topic before committing to non-trivial work - *e.g. [DISCUSSION] How should we support compute?*
